# (and/or)

# !!! ADVANCED SETTINGS !!!
# You can add extra daemons which will be launched within your plugin

[custom]
# here is a space for your public configuration keys
# (ie. overridable by administrator after deployment)
# your keys shouldn't start with an underscore (as they are public)
# and you have to read their value through the corresponding env variable
# and NOT by parsing this file
# a key named "foo_bar" here will generate (in plugin_env) an env var called
# MFSERV_PLUGIN_{YOU PLUGIN NAME IN UPPER CASE}_CUSTOM_{YOUR KEY IN UPPERCASE}
# with the corresponding value inside
